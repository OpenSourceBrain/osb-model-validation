osb-model-validation
====================

Tools for automated model validation in OpenSourceBrain projects.


Instructions
------------

Any _OSB_ project can have automated testing incorporated (currently,
only _LEMS_ and _NEURON_ implementations can be tested thoroughly,
though). In order to enable it:

- create a dry-run <b>O</b>SB <b>M</b>odel <b>T</b>est (_omt_) file, containing the
  target model file and the simulator, e.g.
 
      echo -e "target: LEMS_hh_nostim.xml\nengine: LEMS" > NeuroML2/hh.omt
 

- copy the [travis config file template](templates/travis.yml.template) to the projects' root dir,
  and rename it to *.travis.yml* (don't forget the leading dot!):

      cd OSB_proj_dir
      wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borismarin/osb-model-validation/master/templates/travis.yml.template
      mv travis.yml.template .travis.yml


Once these changes are pushed to the _github_ repo, travis will run
the tests automatically. You can check the results at
http://travis-ci.org/OpenSourceBrain/project_name (and ideally add a
travis build badge to the projects' Readme.md file). Check 
[this project](https://github.com/borismarin/hh-testing) for a working example. 


After this initial simple test passes, you can start writing more
elaborate tests by creating a <b>M</b>odel <b>E</b>mergent <b>P</b>roperties (_mep_)
file and corresponding _omt_ tests. Examples of supported constructs can be found [here]
(https://github.com/borismarin/hh-testing). Notice that _omt_ tests will
be automatically discovered by travis, _regardless_ of their location.
    

If you are wise and want to run the tests locally before submitting
your changes to github, install the omv python package

    pip install git+https://github.com/borismarin/osb-model-validation.git

This package provide the *omv' command line utility:

- *omv test <filename.omt>*, which runs a specific test locally

- *omv all*, which recursively discovers all _.omt_ files in the
  project and runs them (this is the command used by travis).

- *omv validate_mep <filename.mep>*, to validate a _.mep_ file
  against the current _mep_ schema.

Evidently, we will provide a *validate_omt* script as soon as we agree on 
its schema.

In other words, to run all _omt_ tests inside a project: 

    cd OSB_proj_dir
    omv_alltests
